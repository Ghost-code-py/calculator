# calculator
A simple calculator for my github. Here i just used the basics - HTML, CSS, javascript


Used grids display and buttons to make it, putting some style from CSS for a better visual and used javascript for functions.


Really don't have that much to say, first of first project that i ever made and posting here
just to have something to someone see. This time i'm just finalizating another projects and after
this i'll bring them to here.
